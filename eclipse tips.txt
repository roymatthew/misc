If elcipse stops loading contents or shutsdown throwing error relate to "No more handles"

I had the same problem. Deleting .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi worked. I am not sure of the root cause, though.

OR

Move the contents of "plugins" folder to some other folder and restart eclipse. Eclipse will add all these plugins after restart. Replace the new folders with the copied folders.
