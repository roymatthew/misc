Things aren't installed to locations in the Linux/UNIX world like they are in the Windows (and even somewhat in the Mac) world. They are more distributed. Binaries are in /bin or /sbin, libraries are in /lib, icons/graphics/docs are in /share, configuration is in /etc and program data is in /var. The /bin,lib,sbin contain the core applications needed for booting and the /usr contains all the other user and system applications

Set JAVA_HOME / PATH for a single user

Login to your account and open .bash_profile file
$ vi ~/.bash_profile
Set JAVA_HOME as follows using syntax export JAVA_HOME=<path-to-java>. If your path is set to /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java, set it as follows:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java
Set PATH as follows:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin
Feel free to replace /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07 as per your setup. Save and close the file. Just logout and login back to see new changes. Alternatively, type the following command to activate the new path settings immediately:
$ source ~/.bash_profile
OR
$ . ~/.bash_profile
Verify new settings:
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
$ echo $PATH
